# Weather Dashboard

This is a current weather and weather forecaster app that pulls data for a specified city.  

## Instructions

Interactivity is through the text input in the left column, where the user types in the desired city, and the blue search button next to it to initiate the search with the specified city.  

The current weather conditions for the specified city are processed and displayed in the main right panel towards the top, while the 5 day forecast is displayed in blue blocks towards the bottom.  

### Notes 

The OpenWeather API is used for gathering the weather data.  UV index safety levels are obtained from "The Ozone Hole" web site:  http://www.theozonehole.com/uvindex.htm
